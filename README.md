# Writer's Deck

Writer's Deck is a website where users can organize their notes into cards. They can choose to keep these cards private, or to share them and collaborate with other users. To see the mockup designed for this website, please go to [Writer's Deck - Mockup.pdf](https://github.com/Salina-Bee/writers-deck/blob/main/Writer's%20Deck%20-%20Mockup.pdf)

## Scope and Requirements

### Must have:
- the ability to create a user account
- the ability to create, view, edit, and delete projects
- for each project, the ability to create, view, edit, and delete cards
- the ability to share cards between different users, and collaborate in real-time 

### Should have:
- an overview section (the "card table"), where cards can be organized and positioned to create a bigger picture
- popup components, which explain any parts of the UI which may be confusing to new users
- an example project that showcases Writer's Deck's main features
- auto-save and version control on all cards, similar to Google Docs

### Could have:
- customization settings which allow users to change the colours of their workspace (e.g. light mode vs dark mode)
- the ability to add icons to cards, making it easier to distinguish one from another (e.g. setting cards can all be a certain shade of purple, but the icons help to distinguish which region is detailed in which card)
- recommended sections for each card type (e.g. for a character card, recommendations may include "Personality" or "Background")
- announcements in the User homepage, explaining any new features or changes to existing ones
- optional notifications when changes are being made by other users

### Won't have:
- AI help assistants/chatbots
- a section where the Writer's Deck community can communicate and collaborate publicly, like in forums or social media platforms

Changes made:
-Project Overview page layout has been updated, removing the sidebar and making the overall design much simpler and more responsive.
-Users can now update project name and summary in the Project Overview page. This includes error handling for the project name.

To-do: 
-Allow users to add collaborators for their project. Display all collaborators via table, where the first column is their username, and the second column is their permissions (read-only, or read-write). Include error handling. 
-Display project cards, including their name and design.
-If the user is not authorized to view project details, show some error message that allows them to return to their own project page.

Known errors/issues:
-for My Projects, need to rewrite the useEffect hook so that logout and navigate don't cause the function to run more often than necessary; alternatively, check for token expiry sooner rather than later

(Last updated: 11/11/2024)

Changes made:
-Adjusted the My Projects page to have focusable buttons.
-Changed the light gray background to a very light blue, and made each Project item a darker gray.
-Began working on creating the toolbar/menubar for card editor. Current functionalities include: bold, italic, underline, undo/redo, bulleted list, and font family. 

The plan is to have 2-3 tabs for editing a card: one for the card's design, one for the card's metadata, and one for the card's content.

To-do: 

(Menubar.js)
-Allow users to adjust font colour.
-Allow users to adjust alignment: left align, center, justified
-Allow users to adjust font size/create headings.

(MyProjectDetails.js)
-Allow users to add collaborators for their project. Display all collaborators via table, where the first column is their username, and the second column is their permissions (read-only, or read-write). Include error handling.
**Consider the possibility of implementing permissions on card level (as opposed to just project level)? 
-Display project cards, including their name and design. Likely using a slideshow-like implementation, organizing cards by type (Character, Setting, etc.)
-If the user is not authorized to view project details, show some error message that allows them to return to their own project page.

Known errors/issues:
-For My Projects, need to rewrite the useEffect hook so that logout and navigate don't cause the function to run more often than necessary; alternatively, check for token expiry sooner rather than later

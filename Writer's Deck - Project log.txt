To-do: (last updated: 09/21/2024)
-implement page for project overview; don't use the sidebar like originally planned, instead include all project information on the main page, and allow users to browse through cards via pagination + gallery/slideshow design
-for each field in the project details, give user the option to edit and update the information; remember to add error handling too
-if user is not authorized to view project details, show some error message that allows them to return to their own project page.
